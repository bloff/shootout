<p>The shootout has not been updated since the fall of 2001, and is now
frozen as it is. I'm sorry, but no updates will be made.

<p>The shootout is now <a href="index2.shtml">here</a> if you want to
see it. It was never finished and contains errors.  It should not be
relied on as a true inter-language performance comparison.

<p>I've had hundreds of requests to update the shootout since it was
closed. I've filed them all away so I can refer to them if the shootout
is ever resurrected. If you do send me an update, it will go into this
file, and in the unlikely event that the shootout is resumed, your
update/request will be processed in the order it was received.

<p>My favorite languages from the shootout are still the ML family,
and in particular Ocaml. 

<p>Aldo Calpini's Windows version of the shootout is still <a
href="http://dada.perl.it/shootout/">here</a>.

<p>I've been asked about the license of the shootout, and I consider
it in the public domain, except that some individual contributions
contain copyright statements of their respective authors.

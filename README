1) INSTALL
a) perl & php
b) see README_GTOP_INSTALL
c) programming language implementations


2) SETUP
a) edit shootout/Make.header to have the correct path for your installed compilers
b) select only the languages you care about in SELECT_LANGS or delete the source code from the shootout/bench directories
c) cd shootout; make all > log.txt 2>&1


3) ADDING BENCHMARKS:
a) make a new directory under bench. Say it's bench/foo
b) add any source code to bench/foo. Make sure it has the correct
(unusual) extensions. For instance, for c++ code to be compiled with g++,
the extension is gpp.
c) copy and edit a Makefile from another directory.  You may need to
create a local Minibench.conf file in the benchmark directory if
   (1)  You have to rename the benchmark for some reason.  Example:  Erlang
        could not use the name 'lists' as a module name (since it conflicted
	with a system library), so it runs a different name.  This is handled
	via a line in the Minbench.conf file.
   (2)  You have to start the test in some special way.  Example:  The Tcl
        'echo' test needs to run two processes (a client and a server).  It
	uses a Bash script to launch the two programs, since it isn't well
	set-up to fork processes internally.  This is handled by a custom
	Minibench.conf file.
d) in shootout/website/websites/sandbox/include.csv (say), add your test.
e) in shootout/website/desc/test.csv, add your test.
f) add your test to shootout/bench/Makefile.
g) ...more steps to be added as I discover them...

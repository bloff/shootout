<p>Measurements are normalized to the Time-used by the fastest program and to the gzip Code-used of the smallest program respectively. The scatter plots are given more shape by joining each data point to a median point.</p>
<p>Both axes use logarithmic scaling to show the full range of measurements, although there's at least two orders of magnitude more difference between program Time-used than program Code-used.</p>

<p>Thanks to Guillaume Marceau for demonstrating there was interest in this kind of presentation.</p>


<p><br/>There are other ways to analyse and present this data: ask <a href="fastest.php?d=<?=$DataSet?>">Which programming language implementations have the fastest programs?</a> or <a href="fun.php?d=<?=$DataSet?>">Which are best for you?</a> or take the <a href="summarydata.php?d=<?=$DataSet?>">Summary Data</a> and do your own analysis!</p>

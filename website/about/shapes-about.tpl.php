<p>Measurements are normalized as ratios to the time of the fastest program and to the gzip source code size of the smallest program respectively. The scatter plots are given more shape by joining each data point to a median point.</p>
<p>Both axes use logarithmic scaling to show the full range of measurements, although there's at least two orders of magnitude more difference between program run times than program source code size.</p>

<p>Thanks to Guillaume Marceau for demonstrating there was interest in this kind of presentation.</p>

<p>Measurements are normalized to the Time-used by the fastest program and to the gzip Code-used of the smallest program respectively. The scatter plots are given more shape by joining each data point to a median point.</p>
<p>Both axes use logarithmic scaling to show the full range of measurements, although there's at least two orders of magnitude more difference between program Time-used than program Code-used.</p>

<p>Thanks to Guillaume Marceau for demonstrating there was interest in this kind of presentation.</p>

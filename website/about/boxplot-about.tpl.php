<p><br/>Which programming language implementations have the fastest programs?</p>

<p><br/>Read <a href="http://www.lcgceurope.com/lcgceurope/data/articlestandard/lcgceurope/132005/152912/article.pdf"><strong>"Visual Presentation of Data by Means of Box Plots" (pdf)</strong></a></p>


<p>For each benchmark, <strong>F</strong> is the fastest time measurement; for each language implementation, each time measurement <strong>T</strong> is then normalized to <strong><sup>T</sup>/<sub>F</sub></strong></p>

<p><br/>There are other ways to analyse and present this data: look for patterns in <a href="shapes.php?d=<?=$DataSet?>">Code-used Time-used Shapes</a> or ask <a href="fun.php?d=<?=$DataSet?>">Which are best for you?</a> or take the <a href="summarydata.php?d=<?=$DataSet?>">Summary Data</a> and do your own analysis!</p>

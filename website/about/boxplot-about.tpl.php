<p>Which programming language implementations have the fastest benchmark programs?</p>

<p>Read <a href="http://www.lcgceurope.com/lcgceurope/data/articlestandard/lcgceurope/132005/152912/article.pdf"><b>"Visual Presentation of Data by Means of Box Plots" (pdf)</b></a></p>

<p>For each benchmark, <b>F</b> is the fastest time measurement; for each language implementation, each time measurement <b>T</b> is then normalized to <b><sup>T</sup>/<sub>F</sub></b></p>

<p><br/>There are other ways to analyse and present this data: look for patterns in <a href="code-used-time-used-shapes.php">Code-used Time-used Shapes</a> or ask <a href="which-language-is-best.php">Which programming language is best?</a> or take the <a href="summarydata.php">Summary Data</a> and do your own analysis!</p>

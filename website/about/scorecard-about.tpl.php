<p>Read <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=5666.5673"><strong>"How not to lie with statistics: the correct way to summarize benchmark results" (pdf)</strong></a>.</p>

<p>For each benchmark, <strong>B</strong> is the best measurement.<br/>For each language implementation, the best measurement <strong>L</strong> is then normalized to <strong>L &#247; B</strong></p>

<p><strong>GM</strong> is the Weighted Geometric Mean of those <strong>L &#247; B</strong> ratios.</p>

<p><strong>missing</strong> : Language implementations with more than a couple of Timeouts (at the largest workload) distort the ranking - so they have been excluded. They can still be <a href="benchmark.php?test=all&amp;lang=gpp&amp;lang2=java">compared directly</a> against another language implementation.</p>

<p><br/>There are other ways to analyse and present this data: ask <a href="which-programming-languages-are-fastest.php">Which programming languages are fastest?</a> or look for patterns in <a href="code-used-time-used-shapes.php">Code-used Time-used Shapes</a> or take the <a href="summarydata.php">Summary Data</a> and do your own analysis!</p>

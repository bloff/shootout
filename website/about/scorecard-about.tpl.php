<p>(Language implementations with more than a couple of Timeouts distort the ranking - so they have been excluded. They can still be <a href="benchmark.php?test=all&lang=gpp&lang2=java"><strong>compared directly</strong></a> against another language implementation.)</p>

<p>For each benchmark, <em>the best measurement</em> <strong>B</strong> is the lowest non-zero measurement. For each language implementation, the measurement <strong>L</strong> for the language implementation is converted to the <em>ratio</em> <strong>L/B</strong></p>
<p>The ratio can be adjusted by a measurement multiplier (make CPU time or memory use or
lines-of-code more or less important) and by a benchmark weight (make particular benchmarks more or less important).</p>
<p>For each language implementation, we report the <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=5666.5673"><strong>Weighted Geometric Mean</strong></a> of those <strong>L/B</strong> ratios.</p>

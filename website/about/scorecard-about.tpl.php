<p>For each benchmark, <strong>B</strong> is the best measurement; for each language implementation, the best measurement <strong>L</strong> is then normalized to <strong><sup>L</sup>/<sub>B</sub></strong></p>

<p><strong>GM</strong> is the Weighted Geometric Mean of those <strong><sup>L</sup>/<sub>B</sub></strong> ratios.

<p><strong>missing</strong> : Language implementations with more than a couple of Timeouts distort the ranking - so they have been excluded. They can still be <a href="benchmark.php?test=all&amp;lang=gpp&amp;lang2=java"><strong>compared directly</strong></a> against another language implementation.</p>

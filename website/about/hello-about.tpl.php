<p>Each program should be implemented the <a

<p>Each program should print &quot;hello world&quot and exit.</p>

<p>Correct output N = 1 is:
<pre>
hello world
</pre>
</p>

<p>This benchmark measures startup costs. It is run differently than the others - each program is run N times in a loop by a shell script wrapper.</p>
<p>The CPU Times measured in this test are used to adjust <a

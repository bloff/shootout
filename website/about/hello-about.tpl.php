<p><strong>diff</strong> program output N = 1 with this <a href="iofile.php?test=<?=$SelectedTest;?>&amp;lang=<?=$SelectedLang;?>&amp;file=output">output file</a> to check your program is correct before contributing.
</p>

<p>Each program should be implemented the <a
  href="faq.php?sort=<?=$Sort;?>#sameway"><strong>same&nbsp;way</strong></a> - the same way as this <a href="benchmark.php?test=hello&amp;lang=perl&amp;sort=<?=$Sort;?>">Perl program</a>.</p>

<p>Each program should print &quot;hello world&quot; and exit.</p>

<p>This benchmark measures startup costs. It is run differently than the others - each program is run N times in a loop by a shell script wrapper. We show the mean CPU time.</p>

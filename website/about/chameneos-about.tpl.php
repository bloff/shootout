<p>Each program should</p>
<ul>
<li>create four differently coloured (blue, red, yellow, blue) concurrent chameneos creatures</li>
<li>each creature will repeatedly go to the meeting place and meet, or wait to meet, another chameneos</li>
<li>each creature will change colour to complement the colour of the chameneos that they met</li>
<li>after N total meetings have taken place, any creature entering the meeting place will take on a faded colour, report the number of creatures it has met, and end</li>
<li>write the sum of reported creatures met</li>
</ul>

<p>Correct output N = 100 is:</p> 
<pre>200</pre><br />

<p>The chameneos benchmark is a simplistic adaptation of <a href="http://cedric.cnam.fr/PUBLIS/RC474.pdf">"Chameneos, a Concurrency Game for Java, Ada and Others"</a> 100KB pdf (which includes example implementations in Java, Ada and C).</p>

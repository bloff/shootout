<p>This is an updated version of Doug Bagley's original
<a href="http://www.bagley.org/~doug/shootout">
Great Computer Language Shootout</a>; updated with new languages
and revised to work with modern compilers.</p>
<p>Doug Bagley's original goal was to compare all the major
scripting languages.  Later, compiled languages were added and they now make up a large part of the project.</p>

<p>Our goals are to learn about new languages, compare them in various (possibly
meaningless) ways and, most importantly, have some fun!</p>

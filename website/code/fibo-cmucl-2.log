COMMAND LINE (%A is single numeric argument):

 /usr/bin/sbcl --noinform --core sbcl.core --userinit /dev/null --sysinit /dev/null --load fibo.cmucl-2.sbcl_run %A
fatal error encountered in SBCL pid 13914:
can't load .core for different runtime, sorry
The system is too badly corrupted or confused to continue at the Lisp
level. If the system had been compiled with the SB-LDB feature, we'd drop
into the LDB low-level debugger now. But there's no LDB in this build, so
we can't really do anything but just exit, sorry.
TEST FAILED - Child processed exited with error code (1)

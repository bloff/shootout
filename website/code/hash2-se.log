****** Warning: Class DICTIONARY is now a deferred class with
two different implementations: HASHED_DICTIONARY and AVL_DICTIONARY.
The HASHED_DICTIONARY implementation corresponds to the good old
DICTIONARY class (i.e. hash_code based implementation). The new
AVL_DICTIONARY implementation is a tree based implementation with
a different generic constraint. Please, also note that it is not
necessary to change the corresponding declaration of the target
entity and that you can select the best implementation by changing
only this create statement.
Line 21 column 3 in HASH2 (./hash2.e):
    !!hash2.with_capacity(10000);
    ^

****** Warning: Automatic replacement of DICTIONARY with HASHED_DICTIONARY
here (please update your code).

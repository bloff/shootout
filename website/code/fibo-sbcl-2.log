[doing purification: roots handlersfatal error encountered in SBCL pid 26745(tid 1075455816):
%PRIMITIVE HALT called; the party is over.

The system is too badly corrupted or confused to continue at the Lisp
level. If the system had been compiled with the SB-LDB feature, we'd drop
into the LDB low-level debugger now. But there's no LDB in this build, so
we can't really do anything but just exit, sorry.

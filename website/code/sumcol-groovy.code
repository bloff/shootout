    Each program should be implemented the same way - the same way as this Icon program.

    The sum-file benchmark measures line-oriented I/O and string conversion.

    Each program should:

        * read integers from stdin, one line at a time
        * print the sum of those integers

    Correct output for this 6KB input file is:

    500


    Programs should use built-in line-oriented I/O functions rather than custom-code. No line will exceed 128 characters, including
	newline. Reading one line at a time, the programs should run in constant space.

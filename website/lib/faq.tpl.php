<dd>
<p>We use a simple script to <strong>split a single source file</strong> into multiple target source files.</p>
<p>One of the target source files <em>must</em> have the same filename as the original single source file, and is expected to be the 'main' program.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="benchmark.php?test=nbody&amp;lang=se">Eiffel <em>nbody.e</em> source file</a> will be split into 3 target source files - <em>nbody.e, body.e, nbody_system.e</em> - 
each new target source file will start from the <strong>comment line</strong> which included the SPLITFILE=<em>target-filename</em> directive and run to the line preceding the next
 SPLITFILE=<em>target-filename</em> directive or end-of-file.</p>
<p>So, the new target source file <em>body.e</em> will start with the line</p>
<tt>-- SPLITFILE=body.e</tt>

<tt>end -- class BODY</tt>

</dd>

<dt><a href="#id" name="id">What do #2 #3 mean?</a></dt>
<dd><p>Nothing - they are arbitrary suffixes that identify a specific program.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a href="#fullcpu" name="fullcpu">What does Full CPU Time mean?</a></dt>
<dd><p>Full CPU Time means <strong>program usr+sys time</strong> which includes the time taken to startup and shutdown the program. For language implementations that use a Virtual Machine the Full CPU Time includes the time taken to startup and shutdown the VM.</p>
<p>You can get a vague idea of the difference in startup time between language implementations from the <a href="benchmark.php?test=hello&amp;lang=all" title="Compare performance on the startup benchmark"><strong>startup benchmark</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes Java programmers point out that JVM profiling and dynamic compilation will improve program performance when the same program is used again and again and again without shutting down the JVM. That's true.</p>

<p>Let's pretend that we don't startup the JVM or load all those class files, and let's pretend the same program is used again and again and again 1,000 times without any other program being used, and let's pretend we don't shutdown the JVM. Let's pretend that we luckily used the program after a mass of JVM profiling and dynamic compilation has taken place - so we get all the benefit of dynamic compilation without paying any of the cost.</p>

<p>Here are some examples where we measured elapsed time once the Java program had started, and measured the same program again and again and again 1,000 times (taking from 30 minutes to over 4 hours). Then because we are so lucky we selected the fastest elapsed time, taking all the benefit and none of the cost:</p>

<p>As part of performance analysis, those differences hint at how much is not accounted for by JVM startup or dynamic compilation, and how little or how much we might still be able to achieve by contributing better programs.</p>

 differences were simply better algorithms.</p>
<p>After hearing many arguments, it seems <em>to me</em> that we should think of <em>same way</em> (same algorithm) tests as <strong>benchmarks</strong>, and
 we should think of <em>same thing</em> (same result) tests as <strong>contests</strong>.</p>
<p>At present, we are only trying to show benchmarks.</p>

<dt><a href="#acceptable" name="acceptable">Why don't you include my favourite language?</a></dt>
<dd><p>Is the language implementation</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Used?</strong> There are way too many dead languages and unused new languages - see <a href="http://people.ku.edu/~nkinners/LangList/Extras/langlist.htm">The Language List</a> and <a href="http://www.levenez.com/lang/">Computer Languages History</a></li>
<li><strong>Interesting?</strong> Is there something significant and interesting about the language, and will that be revealed by these simple benchmark programs?</li>
</ul>
<p>We will accept <strong>and reject</strong> languages in a capricious, unfair, biased fashion.</p>

<dt><a href="#acceptablemore" name="acceptablemore">Why don't you include my favourite language?</a></dt>
<dd><p>Can the language implementation be used to write most of our benchmark programs?</p> 
<p><strong>Must have</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/" title="Debian packages">Debian package</a> (either from Debian itself, or the primary authors of the language)
or a <a href="http://packages.gentoo.org/categories/" title="Gentoo ebuilds">Gentoo ebuild</a> or build and install with <tt>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</tt> and a default target of <tt>/usr/local.</tt></li>
<li>Command-line argument handling.</li>
<li>32-bit Integers.</li>
<li>Double precision floating point numbers.</li>
<li>Line-oriented read &amp; write from stdin &amp; stdout.</li>
<li>Documentation.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Should have</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Buffered stdio.</li>
<li>Dynamic hash tables and sequences (arrays or lists).</li>
<li>Exception handling.</li>
<li>Regular Expressions (preferably Perl compatible).</li>
<li>Concurrency (threads, coroutines, &#8230;)</li>
<li>TCP/IP Sockets.</li>
</ol>

<dt><a href="#please" name="please">Please will you include my favourite language?</a></dt>
<dd><p>Maybe we will when you write many benchmark programs in your favourite language, and contribute them to "The Computer Language Shootout" :-)</p>
<p>Browse <span class="sandbox"><a title="Alpha benchmarks and more language implementations" href="<?=SANDBOX_SITE;?>index.php" >&nbsp;The&nbsp;Sandbox&nbsp;</a></span> website to see if your favourite language is already shown.</p>
<p>Browse <a href="https://alioth.debian.org/tracker/index.php?group_id=30402&amp;atid=411005"><strong>Feature Requests</strong></a> with Category <strong>New Language</strong> to see if it's already been suggested.
You'll see that several languages have been <em>suggested</em> but no one has contributed programs yet.</p>

<dd><p>Doug Bagley created <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040401204425/www.bagley.org/~doug/shootout/index2.shtml" title="Doug Bagley's website from the Internet Archive">"The Great Computer Language Shootout"</a>, and it was active until 2001.</p>
<p>Aldo Calpini ported that to create <a href="http://dada.perl.it/shootout/" title="The Computer Language Shootout for MS Windows programming languages">"The Great Win32 Computer Language Shootout"</a> - it was last updated June 2003.</p>
<p>In mid-2004 <strong>Brent Fulgham revived</strong> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040611035744/http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/" title="Brent Fulgham's website from the Internet Archive">"The Great Computer Language Shootout"</a> here on Alioth&nbsp;Debian.org</p>
<p>In the following months, things started to change. The website was redesigned showing the original benchmarks in a new way; then benchmarks were deprecated and new benchmarks were added. We continue to experiment on <span class="sandbox"><a title="Alpha benchmarks and more language implementations" href="<?=SANDBOX_SITE;?>index.php" >&nbsp;The&nbsp;Sandbox&nbsp;</a></span> website.</p>
<p>In late-2005 Isaac Gouy started to experiment with the <span class="gp4"><a title="Browse the Gentoo : Intel&#174; Pentium&#174; Computer Language Shootout" href="<?=GP4_SITE;?>index.php" >&nbsp;Gentoo&nbsp;:&nbsp;Intel&#174;&nbsp;Pentium&#174;&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a></span> website. Who knows where it will end?</p>

<dt><a href="#finish" name="finish">When will the Language Shootout be finished?</a></dt>
<dd><p>Never. There will always be new languages, new versions of languages, more sensible benchmarks, faster more-elegant programs, new operating systems, better graphics&#8230; And the project team will change over time, and the measurements and presentation will change with them.</p>

<p>When we can! We already spend way-too-much personal-time on this website. Things get-done when they get-done. <a href="#status"><strong>&darr;&nbsp;Check the status</strong></a> and check the <strong>most recent measurement</strong> date on the website.</p>

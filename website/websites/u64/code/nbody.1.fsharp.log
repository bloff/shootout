\home\dunham\Documents\benchmarksgame_onecore\nbody\tmp\nbody.fs(8,1): warning FS0892: This declaration opens the module 'Microsoft.FSharp.Compatibility.Array', which is marked as 'RequireQualifiedAccess'. In a future version of F#, it will be an error to open this module. Adjust your code to use qualified references to the elements of the module instead, e.g. 'List.map' instead of 'map'. This change will ensure that your code is robust as new constructs are added to libraries.

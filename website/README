 OVERVIEW

 - this is a low volume website - about 1,000 unique visitors per day
    and 5-6 page views per visit; with very rare peaks from 8,000 to
    30,000 unique visitors per day.

 - this is by-design a very simple website, which avoids all changes to
    the default webserver configuration (no URL rewriting).

 - this is by-design a very simple website, which only requires HTML and
    CSS support in the browser.

 - this is a dynamic website pulling together a dozen different scripts and 
    data files and configuration files to generate a web page.
   

 BACKGROUND

 - over 5 years this website has changed in small and large ways, and
    the configuration files and script files provide some functionality 
    that is no longer required. Occasionally obsolete functionality is
    removed but usually while other changes are being made. 

   Be aware, there are cobwebs.

 
 - the contents of shootout/website/websites is swept to the webserver 
    on the hour every hour.

   There is neither a need to update so frequently nor a need to stop 
   updating so frequently.

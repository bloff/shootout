 OVERVIEW

 - this is a low volume website - about 1,000 unique visitors per day
    and 5-6 page views per visit; with very rare peaks from 8,000 to
    30,000 unique visitors per day.

 - this is by-design a very simple website, which avoids all changes to
    the default webserver configuration (no URL rewriting).

 - this is by-design a very simple website, which only requires HTML and
    CSS support in the browser.

 - this is a dynamic website pulling together a dozen different scripts and 
    data files and configuration files to generate a web page.
   


 #1 BACKGROUND

 - over 5 years this website has changed in small and large ways, and
    the configuration files and script files provide some functionality 
    that is no longer required. Occasionally obsolete functionality is
    removed but usually while other changes are being made. 

   Be aware, there are cobwebs.

 
 - the contents of shootout/website/websites is swept to the webserver 
    on the hour every hour.

   There is neither a need to update so frequently nor a need to stop 
   updating so frequently.

 #2 EXAMPLE PAGE - http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64/csharp.php

 - csharp.php

   <?php
   ob_start('ob_gzhandler');
   require_once('config.php'); 
   $T = 'all'; $L = 'csharp'; $metaRobots = '';
   require_once(LIB_PATH.'compare.php');
   ?>

    define paths and some variables for the u64 webpages
    set which benchmarks and which language implementations
    filter the data and set template variables for 'compare.tpl.php'

   (See Brian E. Lozier's website/lib/lib.php)

    

 #3 PHP SCRIPTS

 - Originally more script functions were placed in library files and
    those lib_* files were included into the pages; but now some 
    functions are defined for more than one page, rather than
    include many functions for the sake of reusing one or two.

   So website/lib/compare.php defines Percentiles and Median, duplicating
    the definitions in website/lib/boxplot.php rather than include 
    website/lib/lib_boxplot.php

   (With the notable exception of the objects in website/lib/lib_chart.php)
